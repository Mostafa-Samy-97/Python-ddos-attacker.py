# Python-ddos-attacker.py
this tool will help you to test ddos attacks with random IP Address and Multiple Ports on websites 

Use several machines and execute this code. In the preceding screenshot, you can see
that the machine replies to the source IP. This type of attack is very difficult to detect
because it is very hard to distinguish whether the packets are coming from a valid
host or a spoofed host
